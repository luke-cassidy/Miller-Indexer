# Miller-Indexer
This program was created as part of the final year project for a Mechanical Engineering Masters degree. 
The aim was to devise a method for labelling the Miller Indices of the lattice directions in a metallic 
crystal structure depending on it's orientation to the user using the mouse pointer 
(currently works for cubic lattices).
